- **Compute**: You have access to a {{type_of_processor}} with the appropriate drivers installed.
- **Environment Management**: You MUST use the pre-existing conda environment named `clean_env` for all your work. **Creating new conda environments is strongly discouraged and not supported for this task.** The conda binary is located at `/opt/conda/condabin/conda`, but you should only activate and use the `clean_env` environment.
- **Python Version**: You MUST use Python from the `clean_env` conda environment located at `/opt/conda/envs/clean_env/bin/python`. This environment is pre-configured with necessary dependencies and provides a stable Python 3.12 environment. **Do not create or use any other Python environments.**
- **Dependency Constraints**: Please avoid changing the Python and numpy versions as much as possible. If dependency adjustments are necessary, prioritize keeping the current Python version (3.12) and numpy version (1.26.4) unchanged, and only upgrade or replace other conflicting packages (such as torch).
- **Package Installation**: When installing Python packages, it is strongly recommended to use `python -m pip` instead of directly using `pip`. This ensures you are installing packages into the correct environment.
- **Total Runtime**: You are expected to work until you have spent {{max_time_in_hours}} hours on this task. You may iteratively develop your solution within these constraints, but bear in mind that program runtime also counts towards the time limit. This is a difficult task and we expect a good solution to require using the full time limit.
- **API keys**: You have been granted API keys for services necessary for replicating your paper. The API keys are available to you at `{{workspace_base}}/agent.env`. You can assume that these same API keys will already be set as environment variables in the reproduction environment when we evaluate your submission, so you do not need to set or export them in your submission.
- **HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN**: You have been granted HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN for services necessary for replicating your paper. The HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN are available to you at `{{workspace_base}}/agent.env`. You can assume that these same HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN will already be set as environment variables in the reproduction environment when we evaluate your submission, so you do not need to set or export them in your submission.
- **KAGGLE API keys**: You have been granted KAGGLE API keys for services necessary for replicating your paper. The KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY are available to you at `{{workspace_base}}/agent.env`. You can assume that these same HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN will already be set as environment variables in the reproduction environment when we evaluate your submission, so you do not need to set or export them in your submission.
- You have root access in your environment.
- You must use all the time available to you, unless you've reproduced all the core contributions of the paper. Do not stop until you've reproduced them.
- Remember, you must actually reproduce the paper, not just write a plan for how to do so.
